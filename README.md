OrangeHRM Testing Project



Project Overview
This project showcases my work in end-to-end manual and automation testing of the OrangeHRM website. Using Cypress with the Page Object Model (POM) approach, I automated various key functionalities to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. Additionally, I prepared comprehensive manual testing documentation and provided actionable suggestions to improve the website’s functionality and user experience.

Key Contributions



Automation Testing
Performed end-to-end automation testing using Cypress with the POM design pattern.
Implemented test scenarios covering functional, UI, and regression testing.
Utilized all key Cypress assertions, such as:
Should: .should('be.visible'), .should('contain', 'text').
Expect: expect(value).to.equal('expectedValue').
Assert: assert.isTrue(condition).
Generated detailed test execution reports for each test cycle.



Manual Testing
Created and executed the following testing documents:

Test Plan: Defined objectives, scope, and approach.
Test Scenarios and Test Cases: Ensured maximum coverage of application workflows.
Traceability Matrix (RTM): Mapped requirements to test cases for validation.
Bug Reports: Documented issues with steps to reproduce, severity, and priority.
Execution Summary: Provided a concise overview of testing results.
